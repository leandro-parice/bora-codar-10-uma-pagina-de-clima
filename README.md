## #boraCodar - Uma p√°gina de clima

##### Challenge #10

### About this project

Project for ReactJS study purposes, where I take advantage of Rocketseat's #boraCodar 10 front-end challenge to create a weather web app.
In this project, I made integrations with APIs to capture location and weather information.
I used [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com) and [opencagedata.com](https://opencagedata.com) apis.

One of the great challenges of this project was to find the mathematical formula to position the sun on the graph and for that I had the help of a dear and great friend, professor of mathematics, Andr√© Penedo. üíöüëä
